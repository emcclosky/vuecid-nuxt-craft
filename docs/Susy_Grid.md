# Grid System: Susy
If you decide to install susy on top via `$ gulp setup` you get a nice grid system [Susy](http://oddbird.net/susy/docs/).
It can be seen in action on `components/Examples/DemoGrid/Demogrid.vue`.

Most important are the two sass functions:

`span(x of $s-amount-columns)`
(This sets the width: X columns of total $s-amount-columns)

and
`gutter(of $s-amount-columns)`
(This sets the gutter: X gutters of total $s-amount-columns)

The susy grid settings are saved in `tools.grid.scss` (this file is automatically generated during `$ gulp setup`).

To check if your layout is aligning with the grid, one can use:
`background: susy-svg-grid($colors: rgba(#c7eaee, 0.26)) no-repeat scroll;`
on any container to show the grid helper svg.

## Susy Installation
Use the setup client
`$ gulp setup` and choose to install susy with the project.
What it does:
1. Installs susy.
1. Sets up a grid settings file.
