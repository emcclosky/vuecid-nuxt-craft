## Logging
This project makes use of a customized [bows](https://github.com/wearelucid/vue-bows) logger. To use it via this.log('Hello Lucid') you must enable it in your browsers console: Type `localStorage.debug = true` in your browser's console to activate it. The big advantage of this is, that even on production level you can still access logs.

## Sass/SCSS Guidelines and Mixins
See [docs/SCSS_Styleguide.md](docs/SCSS_Styleguide.md)

## Tools
### Grid System: Susy
We make use of a nice sass based grid system: [Susy](http://oddbird.net/susy/docs/)
Most important are the two sass functions:

`span(x of $s-amount-columns)`
(This sets the width: X columns of total $s-amount-columns)

and
`gutter(of $s-amount-columns)`
(This sets the gutter: X gutters of total $s-amount-columns)


The susy grid settings are saved in `tools.grid.scss`.
To check if your layout is aligning with the grid, one can use: 
`background: susy-svg-grid($colors: rgba(#c7eaee, 0.26)) no-repeat scroll;` 
on any container to show the grid helper svg.
